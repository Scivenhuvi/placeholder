A fat, hairy, horny pervert (M, 25, few limits):
Something here that would be nice there, I like the IDEA behind the "your partner has been inactive" pop-up. The problem is that here it usually means a connection failure and you're waiting for no reason. So something like that but actually works.
Also keep the transparent moving hats. Those were fun.
